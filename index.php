    The name of that town is Silent Hill. Although it is known as a scenic resort area, it is a cursed place where
    the town's former inhabitants were once driven away, brutal executions were once carried out, and a mysterious
    plague was once prevalent. The town is centered around Toluca Lake, from which a thick fog perpetually enshrouds
    the area and makes vague the reality and dreams of those who visit the town. And according to those who have seen
    them, there are also times when "things" that should not naturally exist appear.

<p>Silent Hill is bisected horizontally by the lake.</p>

<p>
  Because of this, the town's weather is usually foggy and misty, amplified by the lake on colder days, as sunny days
  are a rarity. The district of Paleville is in the northern area, and South Vale is on the opposing lake shore.

<p>The town features fog-covered streets, abandoned buildings, and a desolate atmosphere.</p>
<p>Silent Hill has been the site of brutal executions and tragedies, leaving a psychic scar that manifests as supernatural phenomena.</p>
